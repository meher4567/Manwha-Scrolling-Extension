# Smart Scroll Extension - Development Progress (Up to Stage 2)

## Overview
Smart Scroll is a browser extension for automatically scrolling manga/manhwa chapters with intelligent content detection, auto-navigation between chapters, and user control features.

---

## Stage 1: Core Functionality ✅

### 1.1 Auto-Scroll System
- **Implemented**: Smooth auto-scrolling with configurable speed (10-200)
- **Features**:
  - Smooth acceleration/deceleration transitions
  - Zoom-level compensation for consistent scrolling across different zoom settings
  - Page height stability detection (slows down when images are loading)
  - Reading mode multipliers (focus: 0.7x, skim: 1.5x, binge: 1.2x)

### 1.2 Content Analysis & Adaptive Speed
- **Intelligent Speed Adjustment** based on content type:
  - Heavy dialogue (text density > 0.8): 40% base speed
  - Moderate dialogue (0.6-0.8): 60% base speed
  - Mixed content (0.4-0.6): 80% base speed
  - Action scenes (< 0.4): 110% base speed
  - Chapter breaks/whitespace: 250% base speed
- **Panel Detection**: Analyzes image sizes to determine content type
- **Zoom-aware**: Normalizes measurements for different zoom levels

### 1.3 Comment Section Detection
- **Multi-language Support**: English, Korean (댓글), Japanese (コメント), Chinese (评论), Spanish/Portuguese (comentario)
- **Detection Methods**:
  - ID and class name pattern matching
  - Disqus iframe detection
  - Facebook plugins detection
- **Behavior**: Scrolling stops smoothly when comment section is reached
- **Console Logging**: Only logs when comment section is detected (minimal output)

### 1.4 Chapter Navigation System
- **3-Tier Priority System** for finding "Next Chapter" links:
  - **Priority 1** (Highest confidence): `rel="next"`, `.next-chapter`, `.next`
  - **Priority 2** (Medium confidence): Buttons with "next", aria-labels
  - **Priority 3** (Fallback): Text-based search for "next chapter", "다음", "次", "下一"
- **Smart Link Filtering**: Skips social media and spam links (Facebook, Twitter, Discord, Patreon, ads)
- **Console Logging**: Only logs priority level of detected link or navigation errors
- **Auto-Restart**: Automatically resumes scrolling on new chapter load

### 1.5 Countdown Notification System
- **Visual Notification**: Shows 5-second countdown before advancing to next chapter
- **Cancel Button**: User can cancel auto-advance during countdown
- **Smooth UX**: Only appears when comment section is reached
- **Auto-dismiss**: Disappears after completion or cancellation

---

## Stage 2: User Control & Polish ✅

### 2.1 Emergency Stop Feature
- **Mouse Shake Detection**: 
  - Tracks mouse movement velocity and distance
  - Triggers emergency stop when average movement > 100 pixels over 5 samples
  - Samples every 50ms to avoid false positives
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows "🚨 Emergency Stop!" notification
- **Toggle Control**: Can be enabled/disabled in popup settings
- **Default State**: Enabled by default

### 2.2 Progress Indicator Enhancement
- **Chapter-Relative Progress**: Shows % progress through chapter content only (not entire page)
- **Smart Boundary**: Uses comment section as chapter end marker
- **Accurate Display**: Reaches 100% exactly when comment section is reached
- **Visual Style**: Fixed position at top center, semi-transparent dark background

### 2.3 Console Log Cleanup
- **Minimized Output**: Removed all superfluous debug logs
- **Essential Logs Only**:
  - Comment section detection and notification trigger
  - Priority level of next chapter link found
  - Navigation errors
  - Emergency stop activation
- **Cleaner Developer Experience**: Easier to debug when needed

### 2.4 Popup Settings UI
- **Toggles Available**:
  - Enable/Disable extension
  - Auto-advance to next chapter
  - Wait longer for images (slow sites)
  - Emergency stop on mouse shake (NEW)
- **Speed Control**: Slider with live preview (10-200)
- **Start Button**: Quick access to toggle scrolling
- **Settings Button**: Opens full options page

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Detection Accuracy**: Some sites with non-standard layouts may not detect comments/navigation correctly
2. **Image Loading**: Very slow sites may still scroll past unloaded images
3. **Multiple Comment Sections**: Only detects first comment section found
4. **Language Support**: Limited to major languages (EN, KR, JP, CN, ES/PT)

### Potential Edge Cases
- Sites using shadow DOM for comments
- Infinite scroll manga readers
- Sites with lazy-loaded navigation buttons
- Dynamic URL changes without page reload

---

## Build & Development

### Commands
```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run build        # Build extension (TypeScript + Vite)
npm run dev          # Development mode with watch
```

### Testing Checklist
- ✅ Auto-scroll starts/stops correctly
- ✅ Speed adjustment works (keyboard + wheel)
- ✅ Comment section detected and stops
- ✅ Countdown notification shows correctly
- ✅ Next chapter navigation works (all priority levels)
- ✅ Emergency stop via mouse shake
- ✅ Progress indicator shows chapter %
- ✅ Settings persist after reload
- ✅ Works on multiple manga sites

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome/Chromium**: ✅ Fully supported (Chrome 88+)
- **Firefox**: ✅ Supported (Firefox 109+)
- **Manifest Version**: V3
- **Cross-Browser**: Single codebase using webextension-polyfill

---

## Cross-Browser Installation

### Chrome/Edge/Brave Installation

1. Open `chrome://extensions/` (or `edge://extensions/`, `brave://extensions/`)
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top-right)
3. Click **"Load unpacked"**
4. Select the `D:\CKXJ\ML\TD3\smart-scroll\dist` folder
5. Extension is now loaded! ✅

**Note**: Make sure `dist/manifest.json` is the Chrome version (has `background.service_worker`)

### Firefox Installation

#### Temporary Installation (for testing):
1. Open Firefox
2. Type `about:debugging` in address bar
3. Click **"This Firefox"** in left sidebar
4. Click **"Load Temporary Add-on..."**
5. Navigate to `D:\CKXJ\ML\TD3\smart-scroll\dist\`
6. Select **`manifest.json`**
7. Extension is loaded! ✅ (Will be removed when Firefox restarts)

**Note**: Make sure `dist/manifest.json` is the Firefox version (no `background` section)

#### Permanent Installation:
For permanent installation, submit to [Firefox Add-ons (AMO)](https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/) after Mozilla review.

### Switching Between Browsers

The extension uses different manifest files for Chrome and Firefox due to service worker compatibility.

#### To Test in Firefox:
```powershell
cd D:\CKXJ\ML\TD3\smart-scroll\dist
Move-Item manifest.json manifest-chrome.json -Force
Move-Item manifest-firefox.json manifest.json -Force
```

#### To Test in Chrome:
```powershell
cd D:\CKXJ\ML\TD3\smart-scroll\dist
Move-Item manifest.json manifest-firefox.json -Force
Move-Item manifest-chrome.json manifest.json -Force
```

#### After Building:
After running `npm run build`, the Chrome version is active by default. Use the commands above to switch.

### Browser Differences

#### Works the Same:
- ✅ All scrolling features
- ✅ Content detection & adaptive speed
- ✅ Comment section detection
- ✅ Chapter navigation
- ✅ Countdown notifications
- ✅ Emergency stop (mouse shake)
- ✅ Progress indicator
- ✅ Settings popup
- ✅ All keyboard shortcuts
- ✅ Storage sync

#### Firefox-Specific Notes:
- **Service Worker**: Not supported in Firefox 109-120 (background script disabled)
- **Badge Updates**: Won't work in Firefox (requires background worker)
- **Functionality**: Core features work without background script
- **Future**: Full support expected in Firefox 121+

#### Chrome-Specific Notes:
- **Service Worker**: Fully supported
- **Badge Updates**: Extension icon shows ON/OFF status
- **Full Functionality**: All features available

### Technical Implementation

**Cross-Browser API**: Uses `webextension-polyfill` for compatibility
- Chrome: Polyfill converts `browser.*` → `chrome.*` internally
- Firefox: Native `browser.*` API (promise-based)
- **Result**: Write once, runs everywhere!

**Example**:
```typescript
// This works on BOTH Chrome AND Firefox:
const settings = await browser.storage.sync.get(['enabled']);
await browser.storage.sync.set({ enabled: true });
```
